				<p><h4>My name is Brandon Albert Craig and here is a little bit more about who I am and what are my ambitions. I'm 25 year old born on May 16, 1990 and I am the oldest of two children. I grew up in the Roseland neighborhood in which I came up in a fatherless home with my mother, grandmother and my younger sister.
				<br> 
				<br>
				<p>

				 I am a very focused individual that made bad choices in the past but I am in the right mindset and have the motivation to show that a very successful person can come from very high crime rated area without having a father figure in my life. I graduated from a charter high school called C.I.C.S. Longwood Academy and it has prepared me to dressed professional and to get in the right mindset of adulthood. After Longwood, I went to Robert Morris University and studied Computer Sciences while I was there, but unfortunately due to my grades being bad and my financial aid situation I was unable to attain my degree. So, I had to get a job working for Strack & Van Til in Indiana for two years and those were the hardest two years of my life because of me being the minority and the amount of work that was being thrown at me. I got the news that the store would be closing down and I was in a bind because I was unable to find a job after that. I was struggling with a lot of different things from 2011 to 2014. Then I heard about the Year-Up program from a friend and it brought back the motivation, drive and determination to become the person that I should have been years ago. My future goals that I want to accomplish would to become a cyber security agent for the NSA. This work deals with hacking and security for the United States as a whole. This  is what I see myself doing because it is a very rewarding field and it has room for advancement. Also, it can provide me the a career that I can enjoy doing rather than to go to a grocery store that I hated to go to.</p>  I only have one hobby that I really love doing and that would be bowling. I have been bowling since I was eight years old and started leagues when I was eleven. I have put a lot of work towards bowling and it has brought me great joy. I have traveled around to many different places and did tournaments that were very hard but it rewarded me with the experience that I can use to grow and hopefully take it very far. This is a basic sum up of who I am and what I want to become in life.
